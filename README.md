# Job Server

## Overview
The Job Server is the central intelligence of the GoPine distributed computing system. It orchestrates the workflow of jobs across the network of node agents, managing task distribution, monitoring, and result aggregation.

## Purpose
- Acts as the central coordinator for the entire GoPine ecosystem
- Intelligently distributes computing tasks to available node agents
- Tracks job progress and handles failure scenarios
- Provides API endpoints for job submission and result retrieval

## Key Components
- **Job Queue Management**: Prioritizes and schedules incoming job requests
- **Node Registry**: Tracks all active/inactive node agents in the network
- **Workload Distribution**: Intelligently assigns jobs based on node capacity and availability
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of job progress and node health
- **Result Aggregation**: Collects and processes completed job results
- **API Layer**: Provides REST/WebSocket interfaces for system interaction

## Technical Architecture
- Scalable server design to handle growing node networks
- Real-time communication with node agents
- Integration with Job Schemas for standardized task definitions
- Persistent storage for job history and results
- Authentication and authorization for API access

## API Endpoints
The server exposes various endpoints for:
- Job submission and management
- Node registration and status updates
- Result retrieval
- System administration
- Dashboard data feeds

## Deployment
The Job Server is designed to be deployed as a centralized service, either on-premises or in a cloud environment, serving as the backbone of the GoPine distributed computing network.
